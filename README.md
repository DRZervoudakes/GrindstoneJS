GrindstoneJS
=================

A lightweight jQuery alternative for modern browsers with familiar syntax.

This library does not aim to "replace" jQuery: it is merely an ensemble of the functions I use most often, and a few of my own...  This library will NOT work in IE8, but works great in IE9+ and all modern browsers.
